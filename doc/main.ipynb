    "Three models--Cifar 10, VGG-16 and Inception-V3 are implemented to classifiy 12500 cat/dog images. The prediction performance of three model has ranked of top 65%, top 6.6%, top 5.3% in the Kaggle competition respectively. Based on that, we also compare the models and get some interesting findings of the results.\n",
