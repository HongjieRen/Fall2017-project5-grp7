# Project: 
### Code lib Folder

The lib directory contains various files with function definitions (but only function definitions - no code that actually runs).

`VGG` defines the structure of VGG network as stated in the Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition
paper

inception_short_ipynb contains the full code for inception network

`input_train_val_split` contains many functions for spliting and batching trainin and testing data.

`transfer_learning` is the function taking input images and resize to 299 * 299 * 3 and creating the bottleneck.

`vggmain` packs all functions used in vgg network and display tensorboard.
