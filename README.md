![a](figs/4.jpg)

In this project, we use mutiple neural network model to do image recognition. Three models--Cifar 10, VGG-16 and Inception-V3 are implemented to classifiy 12500 cat/dog images. The prediction performance of three model has ranking of 65%, top 6.6%, top 5.3% in the Kaggle competition respectively. Based on that, we also compare the models and get some interesting findings of the results.
